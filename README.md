# P002-Instagram_User_Analytics--SQL-

## Description:
Project Environment:
 
	As a data analyst working with the product team at Instagram. 
 	My role involves analysing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app,
  	to provide valuable insights that can help the business grow.
   
Here, the Project Analysis involves:
 	
  	- a] Tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app.
   	- b]. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business.

 
  For example:
  
		--	a.The marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, 
  		--	b.The product team might use them to decide on new features to build, and 
		--	c.The development team might use them to improve the overall user experience.

  
 The Final insights are then used by teams across the business: 
  
  	 	 1]. to launch a new marketing campaign, 
    	 2]. decide or discover new updated features to build / add into an App. 
     	 3]. Also, to track the success of the app by measuring user engagement, 
      		and improve the experience altogether, by helping the business to grow.

# Approach:
	--1] In this project, I am using SQL and MySQL Workbench as tool to analyse Instagram user data,
  	and answer questions posed by the management team. 
 	--2] Use SQL queries to extract the required information from the database, 
  	ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the queries.
  	--3] The Final insights will help the product manager and the rest of the team,
   	to make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app.

# Insight:
	# Results we achieve After analysing database: 
 
 our insightful findings help market team: 
  
	1]. To find loyal active User & inactive users on Instagram, 
 		to use separate strategies to promote and enlarge userbase.
  	2]. Also, the insights on most used and popular hashtags, 
   		help in ad-campaigns and brand promotions to promote & reach the most people.
   	3]. Some Insights help us, to find out “Bots & Fake Accounts”, 
    	if the Instagram platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts.
